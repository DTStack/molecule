# Installation

1. Open the **Extensions** sidebar in VS Code. `View → Extensions`
1. Search for `Palenight`, choose "Palenight Theme" by **Olaolu Olawuyi**
1. Click **Install** to install it
1. Navigate to File > Preferences > Color Theme > **Palenight Theme** (or any of the variants listed)

Psst! If you have the [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator) font installed, you might be interested in the **Palenight Operator** variant. Also, if you like some good ol' italics on certain keywords, try out the **Palenight Italic** variant.

_There's also an [Atom version](https://atom.io/themes/material-palenight-syntax) of this theme created by me._

## Mild Contrast

This theme uses minimal contrast across the first three variants, but if you feel like the workbench could use a bit more, there's an experimental mild contrast variant under the name **Palenight (Mild Contrast)**, and it looks somewhat like this:
